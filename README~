#minPost 0.01 BETA
#minPost is a simple to use (not setup :P)
#minimal CMS. It has a few things in the header.pl
#and this file (iindex.pl) along with the MySQL
#database settings in settings.pl that need
#changed to fit your site. The README has the
#info on the MySQL tables needed.
#
#TODO:
#1)add better comments
#2)get a more universal theme setup
#3)make a way to change the theme
#4)have the title and other info for the site fetched from the database
#5)make a setup script that takes care of the database and settings
#6)clean everything up a bit
#7)make it resistant to code injection
#8)some other things i can't think of right now
